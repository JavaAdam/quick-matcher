Quick Matcher supports the matching of projects in Package Explorer and SVN log entries in the History (Subversive).

# Installation #
To install Quick Matcher in Eclipse use the following update site: http://quick-matcher.googlecode.com/git/quick-matcher/updatesite/

The minimal required Eclipse version is Ganymede (3.4.0) and Java Runtime 1.6.

**Attention:** Quick Matcher does not work in Eclipse 4 (Juno) because of this [Bug 38379](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=383679).

# General #
The typed filter text matches the target information by a contains comparison. The  `*`-placeholder can be used as a wildcard for any characters. Further the OR-Operator ("|") can be used to aggregate several matching statements.

# Project Matcher #

## Description ##
Project Matcher provides a text field in the Package Explorer's toolbar for typing a substring of a focused project name. All other projects which does **not** contain this substring in their name are filtered. Thus, all unimportant projects are instantly made invisible.
